# Project Description

MediChat is an intelligent AI-powered medical assistant that provides 24/7 health guidance through natural conversational interactions, combining advanced large language models with sophisticated symptom analysis to deliver doctor-like medical consultations. The system features a modern full-stack architecture built with Next.js 15 and Flask, offering multi-modal input capabilities including text, voice, and image analysis, while employing smart questioning techniques that combine multiple inquiries into single conversational exchanges to minimize user friction and accelerate diagnosis. With built-in session memory, the chatbot remembers patient history within consultations, automatically tracks symptoms with severity classification, and generates comprehensive medical summaries that include condition diagnosis, medication recommendations with dosages, lifestyle modifications, warning signs for emergency care, and follow-up timelines—all while maintaining a professional, accessible interface designed for both desktop and mobile users. The application leverages SQLite for persistent data storage, implements real-time performance metrics tracking, and integrates text-to-speech capabilities for audio responses, making healthcare guidance more accessible while explicitly disclaiming that all recommendations should be verified by qualified healthcare professionals, positioning itself as an educational tool that bridges the gap between initial symptom concerns and professional medical consultation.
